## ValueInc Sales Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard project designed to help **Value Inc.**, a global retail store that sells household items in bulk, gain clear insights into their sales, cost, and profit performance using Excel data.

## Project Overview

Value Inc.'s Sales Manager had no access to structured reporting and lacked visibility into monthly costs, top-selling items, and customer demographics. This project bridges that gap using a visually interactive dashboard built with **Tableau** and powered by data preprocessing in **Python**.

## Goals

- Visualize monthly **sales**, **cost**, and **profit** per transaction.
- Identify the **most profitable item codes**, **countries**, and **client segments**.
- Provide actionable insights for the sales manager to make **data-driven decisions**.
- Build a real-world analytics project using **Python + Excel + Tableau**.

## Data Source

- Format: `.xlsx` (Excel Spreadsheet)
- Fields included: `Transaction Date`, `Sales`, `Cost`, `Profit`, `Item Code`, `Client Age`, `Client Type`, `Country`
- Data was cleaned and prepared using the [`valueinc_sales.py`](https://github.com/anushkamore23/Python-Tableau/blob/main/valueinc_sales.py) Python script.
